# a-star-visualization
This program was part of my assignment. We had to create a C++ or python program that would show path finding using a* technique given a starting point, ending point and hurdles. 

I was required to design the complete system for Static and Dynamic route planning for ambulance optimal path (Shortest-distance finding problem). I used python for this. It has the options for (20 x 20) , (40 x 40) or (60 x 60) grids and use cells as 2D locations e.g., start-state (2, 3) to destination (38, 39) with % of obstacles [obtained from the user].  

It then shows the optimal path to the user.
